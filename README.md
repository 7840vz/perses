## Overview

Perses is part of the [CoreDash community](https://github.com/coredashio/community)

Perses aims to become a dashboard visualization tool for Prometheus and other datasources. It will focus on being
GitOps-compatible via a new and well-defined dashboard definition model. It should ease the adoption of the "Dashboard
as Code"

It aims also to be k8s native and to support the Dashboard As A Service.

## Status

Work in progress and far away to be prod ready. We have the API in place, a beginning of the front-end with plugin
oriented architecture.

Dashboard datamodel is still under review.
